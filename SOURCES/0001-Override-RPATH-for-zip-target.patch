Subject: [PATCH] Override RPATH for zip target

Case EA-9181:

CMake calculates the build rpath for the zip target based
on the libraries to which it links.  For some reason, it is
ending the build rpath with a colon.  To prevent this we
must override the rpath for the zip target with one we
explicitly provide.
